# UILab04

For meetings:

Diego: I have time to meet on

- Tuesday starting at 9:30pm
- Wednesday right before class (11:15am-12:15am) or after 8pm if it's only due next day
- If it's due on lab instead, I can meet Thursday 11am-2:35pm at the Keck Center (got a work shift)

Alternatively, I am planning to create a branch and work on it tomorrow even if we cannot meet, so we can both try to
implement the features we agreed.

Right now we need to:

- Make the menu display payment information when clicking a user (I know how to retrieve data by clicking the rows now)
- Functionality to add payments to the users.
- Save/load data for a specific house arrangement (no idea how to do this)
- I think maybe remove housemates, not sure if we managed to implement that.
- Other stuff from the lab doc.

If you'd rather work asynchronously either update the readme here to say which feature you are working on, or
we can coordinate through message. My number is 315-273-9303
